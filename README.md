EndyPresence is a Python script that allows you to customize your Discord Presence. It comes with its own made UI.

## Installation

Grab the latest release from the releases page!

## Notes

If you're reading this, I probably haven't updated my code yet since it's 3AM when I'm updating this file.

## Usage

If you cloned the repo, open up an IDE of your choice and choose "Open Folder" then navigate to the EndyPresence folder then open. Then run the `main.py` file and login to Discord in the default browser. Customize the presence to your liking!
If you downloaded the release, just open the .exe file
