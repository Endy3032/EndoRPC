## What is EndyPresence?

EndyPresence is a Python-based application that allows you to customize your Discord Presence. It features its own made UI using Qt Designer.

## Installation

Grab the latest release and execute the app and you're good to go!

## Notes

If you're reading this, version v1.0 is not out yet. It will come out soon. I'll update the source code after the 1.0 release!

## Usage

### Way 1. Cloning the repo/Downloading the source code

There are several ways to run the file if you have the source code. Use an IDE and run the `main.py` file or just use the command line to execute it.

### Way 2. Downloading the executable from release

If you're on Windows, grab the latest `.exe` file from the release. If you're on macOS, grab the latest `.app` file from the release. If you're on Linux, run the `main.py` file from source (I can't compile a Linux version since I don't have a Linux machine, too lazy to use a VM even though I have one around :))
<!-- If you cloned the repo, open up an IDE of your choice and choose "Open Folder" then navigate to the EndyPresence folder then open. Then run the `main.py` file and login to Discord in the default browser. Customize the presence to your liking!
If you downloaded the release, just open the .exe file -->
